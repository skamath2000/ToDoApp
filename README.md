ToDoApp

This is a React Native App allowing users to create customizable To Do Lists. The app can be run on iOS and Android devices.

Installation/Build

To run and debug onto an iOS device, users can use Expo CLI with a recent version of Node.js. Install the Expo CLI app onto your phone and connect to the same wifi as your computer. Run the following commands in Terminal to start the development server:

cd ToDoApp
npm start

For Android, use the Expo App scanner to scan the QR code and run the app. For iOS, use the device camera to do the same. 

Usage

After opening the app, the user can customize their To Do List with their header and To Do items. Users can check, add, and delete items as needed.
